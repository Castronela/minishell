Pranuj:	I have deleted all of your files for now  from my branch, and replaced the test branch with my branch with all recent changes and updates so far.
		I have changed the folder name from src to src_parse, with the thought that may be its a good idea to keep our works in separate folders and also
		from the perspective of what each one is doing. It will be more convinient for us to find each other's files this way.
		The makefile has not been cleaned up yet.
