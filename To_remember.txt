This is a note for writing things about code that has already been written but 
not thoroughly checked for bugs; and also for feature ideas / insights to be
added later.

1.	Notes to remember:
	-	Checking the 2-way links in the t_lst_str struct, especially the *prev 
		links in that how they have been currently constructed.
	-	Check what the "OLDPWD" variable in the env is, and add it if required
	-	Needs to be checked if these functions in the lst_str_fns.c file need to
		receive double pointer:
		void	ft_replace_node(t_lst_str *old, t_lst_str *new);
		void	ft_del_node(t_lst_str *node);
	-	Ask someone how to handle internal errors like malloc fails, whether to
		exit minishell or just keep going and updating exit-code field
	-	It seems after each cmd_line cycle, the pipes are not being closed as it
		stands at the moment. Should make sure to close them and reuse pipe fds
	-	The clearout fn needs updating, it has some leaks apparently
	-	The fn for opening files and replacing fds has been added but it does
		not seem to replace the fd or may be even create one, as seen from the
		fact that the fd_out remains unchanged even though file_out is not NULL
	-	The exec_built_in function is being called but seems not be executing
	-	Should add the update_env_var() fn after each command executed
	-	Need to check shlvl for leaks, and update shlvl and other fns to update
		also the char** environ. This might be the reason that shlvl is not
		being updated at the moment when a nested minishell is called.
	-	When minishell is called within minishell, need to figure out a way to
		pass it the env variables of the current string shell rather than the
		original one; conversely, check if this is already happening after
		updating the rest of the fns for environ as ./bin/minishell will also
		be called by execve and execve is given the **environ.


2.	Feature ideas/ insights

3.	Niche commands to help with testing and debugging
	
	Command to delete all env variables
	unset $(env | awk -F= '{print $1}')


4.	Default variables set by bash at startup

	When Bash starts up, it sets several default environment variables. Here are some of the key environment variables that are typically set by Bash during startup:

	### Default Environment Variables Set by Bash

	1. **`HOME`**: The home directory of the current user.
	```sh
	echo $HOME
	```

	2. **`PWD`**: The current working directory.
	```sh
	echo $PWD
	```

	3. **`OLDPWD`**: The previous working directory.
	```sh
	echo $OLDPWD
	```

	4. **`SHELL`**: The path to the current shell executable.
	```sh
	echo $SHELL
	```

	5. **`USER`**: The username of the current user.
	```sh
	echo $USER
	```

	6. **`LOGNAME`**: The login name of the current user.
	```sh
	echo $LOGNAME
	```

	7. **`UID`**: The user ID of the current user.
	```sh
	echo $UID
	```

	8. **`EUID`**: The effective user ID of the current user.
	```sh
	echo $EUID
	```

	9. **`HOSTNAME`**: The hostname of the machine.
	```sh
	echo $HOSTNAME
	```

	10. **`HOSTTYPE`**: The type of machine (e.g., `x86_64`).
		```sh
		echo $HOSTTYPE
		```

	11. **`OSTYPE`**: The operating system type (e.g., `linux-gnu`).
		```sh
		echo $OSTYPE
		```

	12. **`MACHTYPE`**: The machine type (e.g., `x86_64-pc-linux-gnu`).
		```sh
		echo $MACHTYPE
		```

	13. **`SHLVL`**: The shell level, which indicates how many nested shell sessions are open.
		```sh
		echo $SHLVL
		```

	14. **`PATH`**: The search path for commands.
		```sh
		echo $PATH
		```

	15. **`IFS`**: The internal field separator, which defines the character(s) used to split input text (default is space, tab, and newline).
		```sh
		echo $IFS
		```

	16. **`PS1`**: The primary prompt string.
		```sh
		echo $PS1
		```

	17. **`PS2`**: The secondary prompt string.
		```sh
		echo $PS2
		```

	18. **`PS4`**: The prompt string for tracing (`set -x`).
		```sh
		echo $PS4
		```

	19. **`BASH`**: The full path to the Bash executable.
		```sh
		echo $BASH
		```

	20. **`BASH_VERSION`**: The version of Bash.
		```sh
		echo $BASH_VERSION
		```

	21. **`BASH_ENV`**: The name of the initialization file to read when a shell is invoked.
		```sh
		echo $BASH_ENV
		```

	22. **`BASHOPTS`**: The list of enabled shell options.
		```sh
		echo $BASHOPTS
		```

	23. **`BASH_ALIASES`**: An associative array of aliases.
		```sh
		echo ${!BASH_ALIASES[@]}
		```

	24. **`BASH_ARGC`**: An array variable containing the number of parameters in each frame of the current function call stack.
		```sh
		echo ${BASH_ARGC[@]}
		```

	25. **`BASH_ARGV`**: An array variable containing the parameters in each frame of the current function call stack.
		```sh
		echo ${BASH_ARGV[@]}
		```

	26. **`BASH_LINENO`**: An array variable containing the line numbers in source files where each corresponding member of `FUNCNAME` was called.
		```sh
		echo ${BASH_LINENO[@]}
		```

	27. **`BASH_SOURCE`**: An array variable containing the source filenames where each corresponding member of `FUNCNAME` was defined.
		```sh
		echo ${BASH_SOURCE[@]}
		```

	28. **`BASH_SUBSHELL`**: The current subshell level.
		```sh
		echo $BASH_SUBSHELL
		```

	29. **`BASH_VERSINFO`**: An array variable containing version information about the current instance of Bash.
		```sh
		echo ${BASH_VERSINFO[@]}
		```

	### Summary
	These environment variables are set by Bash during startup and provide essential information about the shell environment, user, and system. They are used by the shell and various scripts to manage the shell session and interact with the operating system.
