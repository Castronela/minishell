This is a note for writing things about code that has already been written but 
not thoroughly checked for bugs; and also for feature ideas / insights to be
added later.

1.	Notes to remember:
	-	Checking the 2-way links in the t_lst_str struct, especially the *prev 
		links in that how they have been currently constructed.
	-	Check what the "OLDPWD" variable in the env is, and add it if required
	-	Needs to be checked if these functions in the lst_str_fns.c file need to
		receive double pointer:
		void	ft_replace_node(t_lst_str *old, t_lst_str *new);
		void	ft_del_node(t_lst_str *node);

2.	Feature ideas/ insights
	-	Feature to be added in the future: the variables can be used to store a
		copy of the env but as a key:value pair using another field, for easy
		extraction during variable expansion. Also, this list may also be used
		to store other external vairables other than env variables which may be
		created by the user during a session.
